# Project 25: Wang-Landau simulations and Lee-Kosterlitz method to study discontinuous phase transitions

This project and all the code was implemented by Jo√£o Pedro Ferreira Biu, for the final project of the course SI2530 Computational Physics at KTH.

The code of the project is strtuctured in the following way:
- The folder `WangLandau/` contains the code needed to run the Wang-Landau simulations and also a Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of Lee-Kosterlitz method to study phase transitions.
- The folder `WangLandau/` is structured in the following manner:
- `main/`: contains the main `.cpp` code to run the Wang-Landau simulations `FirstOrderPT.cpp`.
- `src/`: contains the header (`.h`) and source files (`.cpp`) of the lattice objects and Wang-Landau simulations.
- `lib/`: contains the library files `.a` of the project.
- `bin/`: contains the executable files of the project.
- `results/`: contains the results of the simulations.
- `LeeKosterlitz.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of the Lee-Kosterlitz method to study phase transitions.

To run this code:
- run `make` in the `WangLandau/` folder to compile the code and the libray.
- run `./bin/FirstOrderPT` to run the Wang-Landau simulations, the results are save in the folder `results/`.
- run the Jupyter Notebook `LeeKosterlitz.ipynb` to study the phase transitions, changing manually the value of the system dimension L.
- run `make clean` to clean the project.

Finally, the folder `images/` contains the images used in the report, `joaobiu_finalproject_si2530.pdf`.
